This compiles our program.\r\n\r\nConnect your Arduino Uno board into the computer. Select Arduino Uno under the Tools – Board menu. Make sure that the right USB port is selected under Tools – Port. Click the right arrow (under the edit button in the IDE) to upload your code to the Uno.\r\n\r\nYour board should now be blinking the green LED on the board at a one second rate.\r\n\r\n#Part 2:\r\nMake an ECET130 directory using your file manager. Click File Save As and select the ECET130 directory to save your blink copy in. Save the file as Lab1.\r\n\r\nModify the code to blink your LED at a 200 mS rate. Compile and upload your code to verify it works.\r\n\r\n#Part 3:\r\nUsing a breadboard, connect 3 LEDs to your Uno on pins 7, 6, and 5 . Make sure you use 220 ohm current limiting resistors. Modify the code to turn on and off each LED in turn from left to right at a 250mS rate. This code should run forever. Only one light at a time should be on.\r\n\r\n![fritzing wiring layout](png/leds.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Submit your modified and appropriately commented blink.ino code for Part 3 to the dropbox Lab1 folder by the start of lab Week2.**\r\n**Be prepared to demo your code in Lab2.**",
